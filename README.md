# term_game

Welcome to a small terminal game I made to pass the time.

## Getting started:

1. Download the repo
2. Get on LINUX (if on windows use WSL) 
3. Either launch the already compiled game file or make use of the Makefile with the command "make" then launch the game file (command "./game")
4. You can "make clean" if issues occur with compilation step

## Controls :
- Use z, q, s, d to move around
- Use p to pass turn (attacks still advance)
- All other characters on input are ignored
